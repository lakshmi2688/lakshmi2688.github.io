<h1><strong>data-512-a1</strong></h1>

<h2><strong> Goal of this project </strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2020.
We combine the data from two different API endpoints, the Legacy Pagecounts API and the Pageviews API and perform analysis of the combined data by plotting a time series plot.</p>

<h2><strong>Links to all relevant API documentation:</strong></h2>
<p>In order to measure Wikipedia traffic from 2008-2020, you will need to collect data from two different API endpoints, the Legacy Pagecounts API and the Pageviews API.</p>

<ul><li>The Legacy Pagecounts API (documentation and endpoint links below) provides access to desktop and mobile traffic data from December 2007 through July 2016.

 <li>The Pageviews API (documentation and endpoint links below) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through last month.
