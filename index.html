  <h2>👋 Hi, I’m Lakshmi Venkatasubramanian</h2>
  <h3>Data Scientist @ Microsoft | Ex-Amazon | Ex-Intuit | Full-Stack ML Engineer | Forecasting, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics</h3>

  <p>
    I’m a full-stack Data Scientist with a deep passion for solving high-impact business problems through machine learning, experimentation, and analytics. 
    Previously at <strong>Amazon</strong>, I specialized in designing forecasting and pricing optimization frameworks that guide multi-billion-dollar product strategies. 
    From <em>conjoint analysis</em> and <em>willingness-to-pay modeling</em> to <em>time series forecasting</em> and <em>inferential analysis</em>, 
    my work helped launch and grow Amazon Devices in a data-driven way.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve built and deployed end-to-end ML solutions across companies—driving efficiencies through <em>AutoML platforms</em>, 
    <em>real-time inference APIs</em>, and <em>big data pipelines</em> using tools like <strong>Spark, Kubeflow, and Docker</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>🔍 Areas of Focus:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Time Series Forecasting (SARIMAX, Prophet, LSTM)</li>
    <li>Product Pricing & Conjoint Analysis</li>
    <li>AutoML & Scalable ML Deployment (Databricks, H2O, Kubeflow)</li>
    <li>Behavioral and Market Analytics at scale (Spark, SQL, AWS)</li>
    <li>Experiment Design, A/B Testing, and Causal Inference</li>
  </ul>


  <p>
    💡 I love exploring innovations in <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>LLMs</strong>, and <strong>NLP</strong>, and building intelligent systems that scale.
  </p>
