  <h2>👋 Hi, I’m Lakshmi Venkatasubramanian</h2>
  <h3>Data Scientist @ Amazon | Ex-Intuit | Full-Stack ML Engineer | Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Advanced Analytics</h3>

  <p>
    I’m a full-stack Data Scientist with a deep passion for solving high-impact business problems through machine learning, experimentation, and analytics. 
    Currently at <strong>Amazon</strong>, I specialize in designing forecasting and pricing optimization frameworks that guide multi-billion-dollar product strategies. 
    From <em>conjoint analysis</em> and <em>willingness-to-pay modeling</em> to <em>time series forecasting</em> and <em>inferential analysis</em>, 
    my work helps launch and grow Amazon Devices in a data-driven way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I’ve built and deployed end-to-end ML solutions across companies like <strong>Intuit</strong>, <strong>Meta</strong>, 
    <strong>Tesla</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong>—driving efficiencies through <em>AutoML platforms</em>, 
    <em>real-time inference APIs</em>, and <em>big data pipelines</em> using tools like <strong>Spark, Kubeflow, and Docker</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>🔍 Areas of Focus</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem; font-weight: 500;">
  <li>📈 <strong>Time Series Forecasting</strong> – SARIMAX, Prophet, KATS, LSTM</li>
  <li>💸 <strong>Product Pricing & Conjoint Analysis</strong></li>
  <li>⚙️ <strong>AutoML & Scalable ML Deployment</strong> – Databricks, H2O, Kubeflow</li>
  <li>📊 <strong>Behavioral & Market Analytics at Scale</strong> – Spark, SQL, AWS</li>
  <li>🧪 <strong>Experiment Design & Causal Inference</strong> – A/B Testing, Regression Modeling</li>
</ul>


  <p>
    💡 I love exploring innovations in <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>LLMs</strong>, and <strong>NLP</strong>, and building intelligent systems that scale.
