<h2><strong> Goal of this project </strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to solve classification problems using logistic regression and neural networks. There are 2 parts to this analysis which are as below:</p>
<ul><li>Model logistic regression using Advertising dataset from Kaggle to predict whether Ad was clicked on or not. We also compute different metrics to evalute the model</li>
<li>Use synthetically generated data and make prediction the most accurate decision boundary using neural network</li>
</ul>
