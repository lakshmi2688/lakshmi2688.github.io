The cost of a college education is skyrocketing. It’s no surprise that student loans now make up the largest chunk of U.S. non-housing debt. If we know how much to save for college education in the future, we will have the flexibility of making financial adjustments without compromising on the quality of life and make more informed financial decisions. With this motto, I would like to answer the following questions through modelling:  What would be the tuition fees for any 4 Year public university program in the future?  Which factor influences the education cost the most – Debt_GDP or Consumer Price Index?
