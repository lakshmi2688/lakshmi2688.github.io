<h2><strong> Goal of this project </strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to solve classification problems using logistic regression and neural networks. There are 2 parts to this analysis:</p>
<ul><li>Predict whether Ad was clicked on or not using logistic regression model and compute different metrics to evalute the model</li>
<li>Predict synthetically generated data using neural network and compare it with logistic regression performance</li>
</ul>

<h2> Analysis 1 - Logistic regression decision boundary </h2>
