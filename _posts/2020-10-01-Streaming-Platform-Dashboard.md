The goal of the project is to create an interactive visualization that can be perceived as a go-to marketplace for comparing popular streaming platforms on various metrics. It enables the users to select a platform they want to subscribe to based on their needs. Users can compare streaming platforms based on Genre, content type, average IMDb rating, languages supported, runtime, number of movies and choose the one based on the metric of their interest
