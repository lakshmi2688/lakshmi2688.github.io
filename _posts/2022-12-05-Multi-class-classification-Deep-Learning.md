<h2><strong> Abstract </strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to explore and understand some Deep Learning concepts and apply them to solving this Multi-classification problem. There are 2 parts to this analysis: </p>
<ul><li>Build a Multilayer Neural Network in Python from scratch using various Optimization methods </li>
<li>Implement the same using Tensorflow Deep Learning framework and compare the results</li>
</ul>
