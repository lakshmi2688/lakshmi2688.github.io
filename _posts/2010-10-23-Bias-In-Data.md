<h1><strong>Bias in data</strong></h1>

<h2><strong> Goal of this project </strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to identify what, if any, sources of bias may exist in these datasets, and to develop testable hypotheses about how these biases might impact the behavior of machine learning models trained on the data, when those models are used for research purposes or to power data-driven applications. We perform a self-directed exploratory data analysis and think critically about the implications of the findings.</p>

<h4>We analyze the demographics and annotations datasets and  answer some of the following questions</h5>
<ul><li>Explore relationships between worker demographics and labeling behavior</li>
    <li>How consistent are labelling behaviors among workers with different demographic profiles? For example, are female-identified labelers more or less likely to label comments as aggressive than male-identified labelers?</li>
    <li>If the labelling behaviors are different, what are some possible causes and consequences of this difference?</li></ul>
   

<h4>We analyze the comments dataset for all the comments datasets and  answer some of the following questions</h4>
<ul><li>Analyze the words most commonly associated with each of the three types of hostile speech</li>
    <li>Are certain words more likely to be associated with comments labelled as hostile speech? Are there certain words that are frequently associated with one type of hostile speech (like “personal attacks”) but not others (like “toxicity”)?</li>
    <li>Are these words representative of words that you would associate with hostile speech? Do you think these frequently labelled words are a good representation of hostile speech in online discussions outside of Wikipedia? Of offline discussions? Why or why not?</li></ul>

<p>The corpus we use for the detox project is called the Wikipedia Talk corpus, and it consists of three datasets. Each dataset contains thousands of online discussion posts made by Wikipedia editors who discuss how to write and edit Wikipedia articles. Crowdworkers labelled these posts for three kinds of hostile speech: “toxicity”, “aggression”, and “personal attacks”. Many posts in each dataset were labelled by multiple crowdworkers for each type of hostile speech, to improve accuracy.</p>

<p>Google data scientists used these <a href='https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731'>annotated datasets</a> to train machine learning models as part of a project called <a href='https://conversationai.github.io/'>Conversation AI</a>. The models have been used in a variety of software products and made freely accessible to anyone through the Perspective API. </p>

<p>There are currently two distinct types of data included:</p>
   <ol><li> A corpus of all 95 million user and article talk diffs made between 2001–2015 which can be scored by our personal attacks model.</li>
   <li> An annotated dataset of 1m crowd-sourced annotations that cover 100k talk page diffs (with 10 judgements per diff) for personal attacks, aggression, and toxicity.</li></ol>

<h4>Schema for attack_annotations dataset</h4>

| Columns        | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------  | 
|rev_id | MediaWiki revision id of the edit that added the comment to a talk page (i.e. discussion)|
|worker_id| Anonymized crowd-worker id|
|quoting_attack| Indicator for whether the worker thought the comment is quoting or reporting a personal attack that originated in a different comment|
|recipient_attack| Indicator for whether the worker thought the comment contains a personal attack directed at the recipient of the comment|
|third_party_attack| Indicator for whether the worker thought the comment contains a personal attack directed at a third party|
|other_attack| Indicator for whether the worker thought the comment contains a personal attack but is not quoting attack, a recipient attack or third party attack|
|attack| Indicator for whether the worker thought the comment contains any form of personal attack. The exact question we posed can be found . The annotation takes on value 0 if the worker selected the option "This is not an attack or harassment" and value 1 otherwise|

<h4>Schema for aggression_annotations dataset</h4>

| Columns        | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------  | 
|rev_id| MediaWiki revision id of the edit that added the comment to a talk page (i.e. discussion)|
|worker_id| Anonymized crowd-worker id|
|aggression_score| Categorical variable ranging from very aggressive (-2), to neutral (0), to very friendly (2)|
|aggression| Indicator variable for whether the worker thought the comment has an aggressive tone . The annotation takes on the value 1 if the worker considered the comment aggressive (i.e worker gave an aggression_score less than 0) and value 0 if the worker considered the comment neutral or friendly (i.e worker gave an aggression_score greater or equal to 0). Takes on values in {0, 1}|

<h2><strong>Known issues/considerations</strong></h2>
<p>Impact of Harassment on User Retention uses observational data to study how newcomers behave after being harassed. In the future, the project will be extended to non-newcomers</p>
